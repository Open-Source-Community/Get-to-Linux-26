## 🐧 Get-to-Linux-26

Welcome to the official repository for the **"Get to Linux"** event! Organized by the **Open Source Community (OSC)** at Ain Shams University, Faculty of Computer Science, this initiative is designed to bridge the gap between "I've heard of Linux" and "I live in the terminal."

Whether you are here to escape forced updates or to master the command line like a pro, we've got you covered.
